I started by studying competitors to see what they offered and where they fell short. Then, I identified common problems users faced, like difficult navigation and poor reporting features. To create better flows and screens, I also learned accounting concepts, making sure the system met users' needs. I organized the systemâ€™s content for easy access, created wireframes to plan the layout, and designed the interface to be clear and simple. I tested the system with real users and made improvements based on their feedback. This thorough process ensured the N1 Accounting System exceeded user expectations, providing a smooth and effective accounting solution."
