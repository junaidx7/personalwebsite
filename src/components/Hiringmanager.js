              Everything in this portfolioâ€” designing projects, writing case studies and
              coding this site was produced by my own hands. I never had formal
              education in code, but I learned to code in my free time so I
              could personally showcase my own capabilities and creativity. I
              have spent hours designing and coding this site to put my best
              foot forward and show that I can be, and strive to be the best.
              This site is still under improvement. If you think you like my
              work, please get in touch ðŸ™‚.
