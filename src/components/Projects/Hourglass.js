          body="This project targets independent freelancersâ€”they could be in any field, creative industries like design, writing, photography, art, marketing etc. One problem they all have in common is managing their administrative tasks, such as time tracking, billing, and accounting."
          body1="At its core, the app will offer flexible time tracking through both a stopwatch function for real-time monitoring and manual entry for after-the-fact logging. This timing data will seamlessly feed into an automated invoice generation system, eliminating the need for manual calculations and reducing billing errors. To help freelancers understand their business performance, the app will provide comprehensive income and productivity reporting, offering insights into earnings patterns, peak productive hours, and project profitability. Users can organize their work through a robust categorization system, tagging tasks by project, client, and custom categories to maintain clear records and generate detailed reports. By focusing on these core features and delivering them through a clean, intuitive interface, the app will help freelancers reduce administrative overhead and focus more time on their actual work, ultimately improving their efficiency and earning potential." />

This role required me to manage all aspects of ux and design, communicate clearly with the clients, help navigate and set proper project goals."

This process highlighted the gaps in the market, allowing me to address the cons of other software and improve Hourglass's offerings. "

        <TitlePara

          body="Key Finding: by performing competitor analysis , I discovered a significant gap in the market for freelancer-focused tools. While established players like Toggl Track dominate with multi-platform availability, most competitors target organizations rather than independent professionals. The analysis revealed that existing solutions fall short in several key areas: limited hour tracking insights beyond basic metrics, premium pricing starting at $5-10 per user/month, and restricted access to crucial features like invoicing in free tiers. This research highlighted an opportunity for Hourglass to differentiate itself with a freelancer-first approach, offering comprehensive analytics, integrated invoicing, and a clean, intuitive interface â€“ addressing the cluttered UI issues prevalent among competitors while meeting the specific needs of independent professionals."

This software wont revent the wheel, so I focused on giving users compelling reasons to switch beyond just addressing pain points. The features don't always have to be revolutionary the wheelâ€”even simple improvements that enhance usability can transform a one-time user into a loyal advocate."
